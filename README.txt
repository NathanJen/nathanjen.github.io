Design Notes
- I only created a proudct browsing page for the dog category
  - Clicking on the cat category will bring you to the dog product browsing page
- I only created the product details page for the dog harness
  - Clicking on any item will take you to the dog harness product details page
- No pop ups currently work on the website as I would need JS to implement them
- For the pages that I didn't implement, nothing happens when it gets clicked on (ex: about us)

Extra Credit
- I created a static favorites page that can be accessed by clicking on the heart icon in the header
  - This page is not functional as I would need JS to implement the functionality
- I created the contact page, which can be visited by clicking the "contact us" link in the footer
